    My journey of learning Python began with a desire to dive deep into the world of programming.
    Spending countless hours coding daily, initially as a student and later as a professional, 
    my skills steadily improved. However, I noticed a plateau in my learning curve.
    That's why, a year ago, I made a deliberate choice to embark on the journey to become a master of Python.
    Little did I know that this journey would take me beyond the realms of syntax and algorithms, 
    leading me to unexpected encounters and unforgettable experiences.

    Before I set out on my journey I resolved to act from first-order principles.
    Persisting in this quest would be the challenge of a lifetime, one that I could only hope to
    achieve by standing on the shoulders of giants.

With these principles in mind, nothing could stop me from my quest. Yet, after this intense
study, I decided to first take some time off and travel to Sri Lanka for a month.

    There, the unexpected happened:

    The principles of peak-performance, so deeply rooted in my thinking, must have guided
    me subconsciously to a place where I finally and at once achieved the mastery I set
    out to conquer:
